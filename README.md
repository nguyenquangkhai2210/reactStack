## Hi! You are coding on Pollia front end.

## Setting up project:
#### 1. Firstly install Node.js, I recommend you to install Latest LTS Version.
Download Node.js here:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
#### 2. Open the command line, terminal, powershell or anything similar to that:
```bash
npm install
```
If you have Error while installation, remove file package-lock.json and install again.
#### 3. Run in Development mode.
```bash
npm run dev
```
#### 4. Run in Production mode.
```bash
npm run prod
```
## About project:
**This project is the front-end site of Pollia, a website for travelling**
**The core of project is built with Reactjs, you can visit the tutorial here https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html**
## Good practices:
#### 1. ECMAScript.
This project is using ECMAScript2015 (ES6) and the beyond version.
You'd better learn ES6 from here: https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/
We recommend you to use ES6 for developing instead of normal javascript, for the consistency and convenience.
#### 2. ESLint.
We recommend you to install ESLint extensions on Visual Studio Code (or the similar ones on other IDEs)
What is ESLint? Find out here: https://eslint.org/
The ESLint will notice you where the dirty codes are. You don't need to fix it immediately, but, for the good practices, please do it.
Try to keep the codes cleaner and better in quality.
Tooltip: Try to use Prettier on Visual Studio Code, this will help you a lot while working with eslint.
#### 3. SASS/SCSS.
It's easy to write style in css, however, you'd better take a look at http://sass-lang.com/
We make sure it won't take you so much time, but it's really cool.
#### 4. Update dependencies.
Find out here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates
Why should you update dependencies?
Although the project works well on the old version, noone knows how the future will be, and we have to be responsible for the changes.
Updating frequently will help us be ready with the latest technology, with many new features updated in those libraries.
And the project may be enhanced in performance, besides, we are able to develop a feature with more ease in a shorter time :O
#### 5. Write Unit tests.
Unit tests are not for tester, they are responsibility of all developers.
Unit tests help every components to be in structure, in their purposes, and reduce the impact in the coming changes.
Believe us, UTs will help you a lot in the future.

**Is this project cool? =)) well, we are trying to arrange everything in structure, so try to follow it.**
**If you find anything difficult or misunderstand, don't be shy to ask us for help!**
